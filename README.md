# Responsive Design
## _An Exercise on Media Queries_


This project is still a WIP, and I plan on adding a button for high-contrast mode to practice adding accessibility functionality. The exercise was inteded to practice:

- Media queries
- Flex box
- Design variations across different screens

## Screen Variations

- Mobile: 320px
- Tablet: 768px
- Laptop: 1024px
- Larger Screens: 1920px

What are media queries? It is conditional CSS, that will only render if certain conditions (the min or max screen sizes) are met.
As [Nick Schäferhoff] writes on the [Torque site][df1]

> Media queries are basically a way to write conditional CSS. That means CSS markup that the browser will only render if certain conditions are met. Its most commonly use is in responsive design, where it’s a way to tell browsers to change the display of website elements when above or below a certain screen size.


## Installation

  _* This project is still in progress_ *

- Javascript
- HTML/CSS
- Will add node.js and Express for deployment
